# CSS Extended Color Keywords

This small [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) project displays a table of CSS extended color keywords at different [CSS Module Levels](https://www.w3.org/TR/?title=color) as defined by [W3C](https://www.w3.org).

It does not include any `.vue` module so does not need any processing: `index.html` will run as it is.

Purpose of this project is to have [HSL](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HSL_and_HSV) and [HWB](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HWB_color_model) color space values for these color keywords, what is not so common (only [RGB](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/RGB_color_space), typically).

Upon double clicking anywhere in the table, different kinds of sorting are triggered.

Result can be seen [here](http://narche.myqnapcloud.com/css-colors).
